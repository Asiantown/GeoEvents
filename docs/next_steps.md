# Upgrade Checklist to Reach 10/10

1. **Synthetic Data Coverage**
   - Generate multi-vessel, multi-event datasets to stress-test heuristics.
   - Parameterize vessel behaviors (dwell durations, cluster hotspots) for reproducibility.

2. **Scenario Visualization**
   - Plot coverage/utilization metrics vs. patrol budgets and risk scaling.
   - Provide per-boat timelines or Gantt-style charts for qualitative insight.

3. **Results Narrative**
   - Summarize key findings (diminishing returns, effect of risk scaling) in the write-up.
   - Highlight tradeoffs and actionable recommendations.

4. **Benchmarking** (stretch)
   - Compare greedy heuristic against a MILP or alternative heuristic on small instances.

These add depth to both the analytical rigor and the storytelling requested by OR audiences.
